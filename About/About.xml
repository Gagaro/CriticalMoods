  <description>Add three critical moods and change after thoughts to avoid moods to snowball too much.
  
  New moods are:
  
  * Looking for trouble: Survivor will attack people he doesn't like.
  * Animal killing spree: Survivor will only attack animals.
  * Breaking Spree: Survivor will try to break things around him.
  
  Change to core are:
  
  * Berserk mood is slightly less likely to happen.
  * Critical mental breaks give "catharsis" afterthought, giving +30 needs
  * Serious mental breaks give "feeling liberated" afterthought, giving +20 needs
  * Minor mental breaks give "calmed" afterthought, giving +15 needs
